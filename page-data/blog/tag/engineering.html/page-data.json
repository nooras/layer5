Project Overview & Core Purpose  \\n- **Purpose:** This is a customer support ticketing system built with a React frontend and a Node.js (Express) backend.  \\n- **Tech Stack:** TypeScript, React, Tailwind CSS, Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL.  \\n- **Key Goal:** Provide a fast, reliable, and user-friendly interface for support agents to manage customer issues.\\n\\n## 2. Architecture & Design Patterns  \\n- **Database:** We use PostgreSQL for its reliability and ACID compliance. All business logic involving payments or user accounts must be transactional.  \\n- **Caching:** Redis is used for session storage and caching non-critical data. Never cache user-private data.  \\n- **State Management (Frontend):** Use React Query for server state and Zustand for global UI state. Avoid prop-drilling.  \\n- **API Design:** We follow RESTful principles. All API error responses must include a \\\\`requestId\\\\` for easier debugging.\\n\\n## 3. Code Standards & Conventions  \\n- **Formatting:** We use Prettier with the settings in \\\\`.prettierrc\\\\`. All code must be formatted on commit.  \\n- **Linting:** ESLint is configured with rules in \\\\`.eslintrc.js\\\\`. Pay close attention to rules against using \\\\`any\\\\`.  \\n- **Naming:**  \\n    - Components: \\\\`PascalCase\\\\` (e.g., \\\\`TicketList.tsx\\\\`)  \\n    - API endpoints: \\\\`kebab-case\\\\` (e.g., \\\\`/api/user-tickets\\\\`)  \\n    - Functions: \\\\`camelCase\\\\` (e.g., \\\\`fetchUserData\\\\`)  \\n- **Testing:** Use Jest and React Testing Library. All new components must have at least 80% test coverage for critical paths.\\n\\n## 4. Build, Test, & Deploy Pipeline  \\n- **Local Setup:** Run \\\\`npm install\\\\` and then \\\\`npm run dev\\\\`.  \\n- **Running Tests:** \\\\`npm test\\\\`  \\n- **Build Command:** \\\\`npm run build\\\\`  \\n- **Deployment:** Pushes to the \\\\`main\\\\` branch trigger a GitHub Actions workflow that deploys to Vercel.\\n\\n## 5. Common Pitfalls & API Nuances  \\n- **Stripe API:** All POST requests are idempotent. It's safe to retry them.  \\n- **SendGrid API:** This API has strict rate limits. All email-sending tasks should be pushed to our Redis queue.  \\n- **Authentication:** If you see auth errors locally, it's likely because the Redis server died. Restart it with \\\\`redis-server\\\\`.\\n\\n## 6. Git & PR Workflow  \\n- **Branch Naming:** \\\\`feature/ticket-123-add-search-bar\\\\`  \\n- **Commit Messages:** Follow the Conventional Commits specification. (e.g., \\\\`feat: add user profile page\\\\`)  \\n- **Pull Requests:** Must be reviewed by at least one other team member before merging. Link the associated ticket in the PR description.\\n\")), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Start small, and let it grow.\"), \" Your AGENTS.md doesn't need to be perfect on day one.
